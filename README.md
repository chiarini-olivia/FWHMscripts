Authors:Olivia Chiarini and Roy Prouty 

Research Advisors: Dr. Meyer and Roy Prouty

Purpose: To analyze FWHM data from .fits files given by UMBC's Obsertvatory, compare these to SHARPCAP to see how they are getting their histograms 
for FWHM and focusing analyizse. 


GOALS:
- Load in FITS file
- Find Sources
- Fit Profiles
  - Vertical
  - Horizontal
  - Radial
  - Extract STDV
- Calculate FWHM
- Convert from pixels at arcseconds
