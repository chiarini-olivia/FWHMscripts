# FWHMscripts


Authors:Olivia Chiarini
Research Advisors: Dr. Meyer and Roy Prouty
Purpose: To analyze FWHM data from .fits files given by UMBC's Obsertvatory, 
compare these to SHARPCAP to see how they are getting their histograms 
for FWHM and focusing analyizse. 


GOALS:
- Load in FITS file
- Find Sources
- Fit Profiles
  - Vertical
  - Horizontal
  - Radial
  - Extract STDV
- Calculate FWHM
- Convert from pixels at arcseconds



TO DOS:
- take userinput
- make folder for users to place fits files in
- make filepath dynamio
- figure out how to display data
